# Temporal Cycle-Consistency Learning (https://sites.google.com/view/temporal-cycle-consistency/home)

This is the pytorch version of tcc loss in [repo](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/3002480d94c443da491f194dfdb6358dbc2a4500/tcc). It was used in the CVPR 2019 paper Temporal Cycle-Consistency
Learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07846). 

## Usage

```test_tcc.ipynb``` gives an example of usage both in tensorflow and pytorch version, please refer to it for more detail. Note that, to make a fair comparision, we put the original tensorflow version in folder ```tcc_tf```, which is credit to [repo](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/3002480d94c443da491f194dfdb6358dbc2a4500/tcc).
